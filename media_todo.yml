       Computational theories of the mind seem to be ideally suited to explain rationality. But how can computations be subverted by meaning, emotion and love?

       The leading social networks are the powerful new gatekeepers of the digital age. Proprietary de facto standards of the dominant companies have lead to the emergence of virtual “information silos” that can barely communicate with one another. Has Diaspora really lost the war? Or is there still a chance to succeed?

       This talk will focus on the potential ability of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity to reduce discriminatory policing in Germany.  In the UK, data has been collected during police procedures, allowing for a monitoring and evaluation of discriminatory policing practices. Unfortunately, such an empirically driven policy approach is not currently possible in Germany. This talk will argue that, as a first step, a policy based off the UK approach towards data collection be implemented in Germany to incorporate, rather than ignore, Germany’s diverse identities, and to allow for empirically driven and more effective policing.

       Angae means "Fog" in Korean. The term is widely used in parts of custom code used by the Red Star OS. We will lift the fog on the internals of North Korea's operating system. Our talk will provide information about how privacy is invaded for all users of Red Star OS and how an operating system designed by a totalitarian dictatorship works.

       Gradually we are all becoming more and more dependent on machines, we will be able to live longer with an increased quality of life due to machines integrated into our body. However, our dependence on technology grows faster than our ability to secure it, and a security failure of a medical device can have fatal consequences. This talk is about Marie's personal experience with being the host of a vulnerable medical implant, and how this has forced her to become a human part of the "Internet-of-Things".

      Alain: Simon Menner shows a great collection of pictures from the best
      treasure trove that is accessible to us from surveillance
      states. He tells a good story on how absurd and dangerous surveillance
      is at the same time.

      It's also curious to hear that only footage from eastern countries is
      available, the BND only released 14 totally irrelevant pictures of all
      of the cold war (something like a cork screw...). So of course the
      easter states totally look illegal compared to just nothing.

      "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
      expecting different results."  Albert Einstein - Who did not live long
      enough to see Rowhammer

      Recent studies have found that repeated accesses to DRAM rows
      can cause random bit flips, resulting in the so called Rowhammer
      vulnerability. We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote
      software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also
      extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel
      attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the
      cache.

      phil: Frightening bit flipping. Very in depth.
