       After years of debate, EU copyright law is finally being revisited. The Commission will present a proposal for reform within 4 months of 31c3. And it's high time: There has never been a bigger discrepancy between the technical feasibility to share information and knowledge across all physical borders and the legal restrictions to actually do so. This talk outlines the unique opportunity and the challenge to bring copyright into the 21st century that lies in front of us. Hackers ensured that people were heard during last winter's public consultation. Can they now also ensure a progressive outcome of the reform process?

       Die Kritik am Freihandelsabkommen TTIP und CETA auf die Chlorhühnchen zu beschränken, greift viel zu kurz. Denn bei den beiden Abkommen zwischen der EU und den USA und der EU und Kanada steht noch viel mehr auf dem Spiel. Egal ob Datenschutz, Demokratie oder Urheberrecht – Abkommen, an denen Konzerne unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit mitschreiben können, sind selten eine gute Idee. Sitzungsdokumente mit “unverbindlichen” Lobby-Vorschlägen und Leaks der Vertragstexte lassen wenig Gutes erwarten. Datenschutzstandards laufen Gefahr zu Handelshemmnissen erklärt zu werden. Konzerne pochen darauf, Staaten vor außerstaatlichen Schiedsgerichten auf Schadensersatz verklagen zu können. Was die Bürger wollen, wurde im ganzen Verhandlungsprozess der beiden Freihandelsabkommen nicht einmal gefragt. Doch “Klicktivismus” war gestern – neue Strategien und Tools halfen dabei, eine Welle des dezentralen Protests loszutreten.

        “There will be people who resist adopting and using technology, people who want nothing to do with virtual profiles, online data systems or smart phones. Yet a government might suspect that people who opt out completely have something to hide and thus are more likely to break laws, and as a counterterrorism measure, that government will build the kind of ‘hidden people’ registry we described earlier. If you don’t have any registered social-networking profiles or mobile subscriptions, and on-line references to you are unusually hard to find, you might be considered a candidate for such a registry. You might also be subjected to a strict set of new regulations that includes rigorous airport screening or even travel restrictions.”

       How can the physical universe give rise to a mind? I suggest to replace this confusing question by another one: what kind of information processing system is the mind, and how is the mind computed? As we will see, even our ideas of the physical universe turn out to be computational. Let us explore some fascinating scenery of the philosophy underlying Artificial Intelligence.

       The leading social networks are the powerful new gatekeepers of the digital age. Proprietary de facto standards of the dominant companies have lead to the emergence of virtual “information silos” that can barely communicate with one another. Has Diaspora really lost the war? Or is there still a chance to succeed?

       This talk will focus on the potential ability of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity to reduce discriminatory policing in Germany.  In the UK, data has been collected during police procedures, allowing for a monitoring and evaluation of discriminatory policing practices. Unfortunately, such an empirically driven policy approach is not currently possible in Germany. This talk will argue that, as a first step, a policy based off the UK approach towards data collection be implemented in Germany to incorporate, rather than ignore, Germany’s diverse identities, and to allow for empirically driven and more effective policing.

       Gradually we are all becoming more and more dependent on machines, we will be able to live longer with an increased quality of life due to machines integrated into our body. However, our dependence on technology grows faster than our ability to secure it, and a security failure of a medical device can have fatal consequences. This talk is about Marie's personal experience with being the host of a vulnerable medical implant, and how this has forced her to become a human part of the "Internet-of-Things".

      Alain: Simon Menner shows a great collection of pictures from the best
      treasure trove that is accessible to us from surveillance
      states. He tells a good story on how absurd and dangerous surveillance
      is at the same time.

      It's also curious to hear that only footage from eastern countries is
      available, the BND only released 14 totally irrelevant pictures of all
      of the cold war (something like a cork screw...). So of course the
      easter states totally look illegal compared to just nothing.

      "Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
      expecting different results."  Albert Einstein - Who did not live long
      enough to see Rowhammer

      Recent studies have found that repeated accesses to DRAM rows
      can cause random bit flips, resulting in the so called Rowhammer
      vulnerability. We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote
      software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also
      extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel
      attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the
      cache.

      phil: Frightening bit flipping. Very in depth.
