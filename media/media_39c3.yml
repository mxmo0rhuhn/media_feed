    Blockade über Protest, von Sommerinterviews bis zu Polizeischikanen lassen wir
    ein Jahr Adenauer SRP+ Revue passieren. Das könnte lustig werden.

    Außerdem: alles zum Walter Lübcke-Memorial-Park, den wir gerade direkt vor die

  description: 'Might contain zerodays. https://gpg.fail/


    From secure communications to software updates: PGP implementations such as *GnuPG*
    ubiquitously relied on to provide cryptographic assurances. Many applications
    from secure communications to software updates fundamentally rely on these utilities.

    Since these have been developed for decades, one might expect mature codebases,
    a multitude of code audit reports, and extensive continuous testing.

    When looking into various PGP-related codebases for some personal use cases, we
    found these expectations not met, and discovered multiple vulnerabilities in cryptographic
    utilities, namely in *GnuPG*, *Sequoia PGP*, *age*, and *minisign*.

    The vulnerabilities have implementation bugs at their core, for example in parsing
    code, rather than bugs in the mathematics of the cryptography itself. A vulnerability
    in a parser could for example lead to a confusion about what data was actually
    signed, allowing attackers without the private key of the signer to swap the plain
    text. As we initially did not start with the intent of conducting security research,
    but rather were looking into understanding some internals of key management and
    signatures for personal use, we also discuss the process of uncovering these bugs.
    Furthermore, we touch on the role of the OpenPGP specification, and the disclosure
    process.


    Beyond the underlying mathematics of cryptographic algorithms, there is a whole
    other layer of implementation code, assigning meaning to the processed data. For
    example, a signature verification operation both needs robust cryptography **and**
    assurance that the verified data is indeed the same as was passed into the signing
    operation. To facilitate the second part, software such as *GnuPG* implement parsing
    and processing code of a standardized format. Especially when implementing a feature
    rich and evolving standard, there is the risk of ambivalent specification, and
    classical implementation bugs.


    The impact of the vulnerabilities we found reaches from various signature verification
    bypasses, breaking encryption in transit and encryption at rest, undermining key
    signatures, to exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities.

  description: 'Trump has staged an unscheduled, midair rapid disassembly of the global
    system of trade. Ironically, it is this system that prevented all of America''s
    trading partners from disenshittifying their internet: the US trade representative
    threatened the world with tariffs unless they passed laws that criminalized reverse-engineering
    and modding. By banning "adversarial interoperability," America handcuffed the
    world''s technologists, banning them from creating the mods, hacks, alt clients,
    scrapers, and other tools needed to liberate their neighbours from the enshittificatory
    predations of the ketamine-addled zuckermuskian tyrants of US Big Tech.


    Well, when life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. The Trump tariffs are here,
    and it''s time to pick the locks on the those handcuffs and set the world''s hackers
    loose on Big Tech. Happy Liberation Day, everyone!


    Enshittification wasn''t an accident. It also wasn''t inevitable. This isn''t
    the iron laws of economics at work, nor is it the great forces of history.


    Enshittification was a choice: named individuals, in living memory, enacted policies
    that created the enshittogenic environment. They created a world that encouraged
    tech companies to merge to monopoly, transforming the internet into "five giant
    websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four." They let these monopolists
    rip us off and spy on us.


    And they banned us from fighting back, claiming that anyone who modified a technology
    without permission from its maker was a pirate (or worse, a terrorist). They created
    a system of "felony contempt of business-model," where it''s literally a crime
    to change how your own devices work. They declared war on the general-purpose
    computer and demanded a computer that would do what the manufacturer told it to
    do (even if the owner of the computer didn''t want that).


    We are at a turning point in the decades-long war on general-purpose computing.
    Geopolitics are up for grabs. The future is ours to seize.


    In my 24 years with EFF, I have seen many strange moments, but never one quite
    like this. There''s plenty of terrifying things going on right now, but there''s
    also a massive, amazing, incredibly opportunity to seize the means of computation.


    Let''s take it. ''

  description: 'It is 1976 and the USA long stopped going to the Moon when a Soviet
    automatic landing station called Luna 24 descends to the Lunar surface. It touches
    down on 3.3 Billion year old rock formations at a place no mission has ever gone
    before. What exactly happened remains a mystery to this day, but the space probe
    managed to take a 2.3 m long drill core from the Lunar regolith, packaged the
    sample in a genius way and launched it for its voyage to Earth. Some days later
    the sample entered earths atmosphere and landed in remote Siberia and ended up
    in our hands more than 50 Years later. We tell the story of the sample, the people
    that brought it to Earth and how we analyzed it with the newest methods including
    µm sized high intensity X-ray beams, 30kV electron beams and LN2 cooled infrared
    spectrometers.


    In this talk, members of the Museum for Natural History in Berlin will present
    the story of a Luna 24 sample retrieved by the GDR from the USSR. The sample has
    been almost "lost" to time. When it fell into our hands, we started understanding
    its historical and scientific significance, produced specialized sample containers
    and initiated curation efforts of the sample while slowly understanding its history
    and geochemical composition.


    ### Luna 24 Moon Mission

    What happened on the 18th & 19th of August 1976 on the moon? Why was this landing
    site chosen and how was the sample retrieved and brought back to Earth? Which
    way did the scientists handle these extremely precious samples? Picture: Музей
    Космонавтики (CC0 1.0)


    ### Methods and Results

    Which methods can be utilized to gather new information from such a sample without
    destroying it? Which storage and curation methods must be used to preserve its
    value for the scientists that come after us? How did advanced analytical methods
    like µCT, electron microscopes, µ X-ray fluorescence spectrometers and nitrogen-cooled
    infrared spectrometers contribute to our understanding of the sample?

  description: 'Building electronics has never been easier, cheaper, or more accessible
    than the last few years. It''s also becoming a precious skill in a world where
    commercially made electronics are the latest victim of enshittification and vibe
    coding. And yet, while removing technical and financial barriers to building things,
    we''ve not come as far as we should have in removing social barriers. The electronics
    and engineering industry and the cultures around them are hostile to newcomers
    and self-taught practitioners, for no good reason at all. I''ve been teaching
    advanced electronics manufacturing skills to absolute beginners for a decade now,
    and they''ve consistently succeeded at acquiring them. I''m here to tell you why
    it''s not as hard as it seems, how to get into it, and why more people who think
    they can''t should try.


    Electronics is easier and more fun to get into than it''s ever been before. All
    the tools and resources are easily accessible and super cheap or free. There''s
    an enormous amount of things to build from and build on.


    It''s also never been more important to be able to build and understand electronics,
    as assholes running corporations are wasting their workers'' unpaid overtime on
    making all the electronics in our lives shittier, more full of ads, slop, and
    spyware, and more frustrating to use. Encountering a device that works for you
    instead of against you is a breath of fresh air. Building one is an act of resistance
    and power. Not depending on the whims of corporate assholes is freedom.


    However, the culture around electronics and the electronics industry is one of
    exclusion and gatekeeping. It doesn''t need to be. It would be stupidly easy to
    make things better, and we should. I''ve been teaching absolute beginners advanced
    electronics manufacturing skills for many years now. It''s absolutely shocking
    how much more diverse the people who I teach are compared to the industry. The
    "hardware is hard" meme is true in some cases but toxic when worn as a badge of
    pride or a warning to people attempting it.


    I will tell you why designing and building electronics is not nearly as hard as
    it seems, how it''s almost never been easier to get into it, and why it''s very
    important that people who think or have been told they can''t do it should be
    doing more of it. I''ll tell you my experiences of what building devices is like,
    show and tell a few useful skills, and tell the story of how trying to prove someone
    wrong on the internet turned into a decade of teaching people with zero experience
    how to handle the most complex electronic components at all sorts of community
    events.

    \ on DNA-based cryptography and security systems, in particular zooming in on\
    \ the example of chemical unclonable functions (CUFs) based on randomly generated,\
    \ synthetic DNA sequences. Similar to Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), these\

    \ we explore how CUFs could in the future be implemented as physical security\
    \ architectures: For example, in anti-counterfeiting of medicines or as personal\
    \ signatures for artworks. \nIn a broader sense, this talk aims to inspire a reconsideration\

  description: 'Reports of GNSS interference in the Baltic Sea have become almost
    routine — airplanes losing GPS, ships drifting off course, and timing systems
    failing. But what happens when a group of engineers decides to build a navigation
    system that simply *doesn’t care* about the jammer?


    Since 2017, we’ve been developing **R-Mode**, a terrestrial navigation system
    that uses existing radio beacons and maritime infrastructure to provide independent
    positioning — no satellites needed. In this talk, we’ll share our journey from
    an obscure research project that “nobody needs” to a system now seen as crucial
    for resilience and sovereignty. Expect technical insights, field stories from
    ships in the Baltic, and reflections on what it means when a civilian backup system
    suddenly attracts military interest.


    Since 2017, our team at DLR and partners across Europe have been working on an
    alternative to satellite navigation: **R-Mode**, a backup system based on terrestrial
    transmitters. Our main testbed spans the Baltic Sea — a region now infamous for
    GNSS jamming and spoofing.


    We’ll start by showing what GNSS interference actually means in practice: aircraft
    losing navigation data, ships switching to manual control, and entire regions
    facing timing outages — such as the recent disruption of telecommunications in
    Gdańsk during Easter 2025.


    Then we’ll take you behind the scenes of building R-Mode: designing signals that
    can coexist with legacy systems, installing transmitters along the coast, and
    testing shipborne receivers in rough conditions. We’ll share personal moments
    — like the first time we received a stable position fix in the middle of the Baltic.


    Finally, we’ll talk about perception and politics: how a “research curiosity”
    became a critical infrastructure project, why ESA now wants to build a *satellite*
    backup (with the same vulnerabilities), and how it feels when your civilian open-source
    navigation system suddenly becomes strategically relevant.

    \ Blick auf den gesamten Computer bis hinunter zu den einzelnen Logikgattern ist\
    \ es nur eine Mausradbewegung entfernt!\n\nFactorio ist ein Spiel über Fabrikautomation\
    \ - Förderbänder, Dampfmaschinen und Produktionsketten stehen im Vordergrund.\
    \ Eigentlich ist das interne Logiksystem („Combinators“) gedacht für die Steuerung\
    \ der Fabrik, jedoch erlaubt es auch die Entwicklung komplexer Hardware.\n\nIn\
    \ diesem Vortrag erzähle ich meine Geschichte, wie ich eine vollständige RISC-V-Architektur\
    \ in Factorio  rein aus Vanilla-Combinators erschaffen habe:\nDie CPU arbeitet\
    \ mit 32 Bit-Wörtern, verfügt über 32 General Purpose Register, 128 KB RAM/Persistent\
    \ Storage, eine 5-stufige Pipeline mit Forwarding und Hazard-Handling sowie eine\
    \ Logikeinheit für Branches und Interrupts. Ein Display-Controller steuert eine\
    \ Konsolen-Ausgabe sowie ein Farbdisplay, während ein Keyboard-Controller Eingaben\
    \ über physische In-Game-Tasten ermöglicht.\n\nErgänzt wird die Hardware auf der\
    \ Softwareseite durch das Betriebssystem *FactOS*, das ein einfaches Filesystem\
    \ sowie Systemcalls (zum Beispiel zum Drucken eines Strings im Terminal) zur Verfügung\
    \ stellt.  Außerdem schränkt das Betriebssystem das ausführende User-Programm\
    \ auf einen festen Bereich des RAMs ein und verhindert so direkten Zugriff auf\
    \ die Hardware.\n\nIm Talk möchte ich euch durch alle Schichten dieser Konstruktion\
    \ führen:\nVon den Grundlagen der Factorio-Signalphysik über CPU-Design und Pipeline-Hazards\
    \ bis zur Toolchain und dem Betriebssystem. Außerdem gebe ich einen Einblick,\
    \ wie die Limitierungen aber auch die Vorteile von Factorio im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen\
    \ Logik Simulatoren das Design einer CPU beeinflussen können. Ich runde meinen\
    \ Talk mit einer Live-Demonstration des Systems ab.\n\nDie vollständige CPU, inklusive\
    \ Quellcode des Assemblers, Blueprints und Beispielprogramme, stelle ich öffentlich\
    \ zur Verfügung. Dadurch kann jede interessierte Person die Architektur in Factorio\
    \ laden, erweitern und eigene Software dafür entwickeln.\n\nEs wird im Anschluss\
    \ eine [Self-organized Session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/cpu-entwicklung-in-factorio-wie-benutze-ich-phds-f)\
    \ geben, in der ich eine hands-on Einleitung geben werde, wie man die CPU in Factorio\
    \ lädt, wie man Programme schreibt, diese assembliert und in Factorio einfügt.\
    \ Auch kann man dort gerne mit mir über das Projekt quatschen, ich freue mich\
    \ auf alle Beiträge und Kommentare :)\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\

  description: 'Was passiert, wenn staatliche Domains auslaufen - und plötzlich jemand
    anderes sie besitzt?

    In diesem Vortrag wird berichtet, wie mehrere ehemals offizielle, aber unregistrierte
    Domains deutscher Bundesministerien und Behörden erworben werden konnten - und
    welche Datenströme dadurch sichtbar wurden. Über Monate hinweg konnten so DNS-Anfragen
    aus Netzen des Bundes empfangen werden - ein erhebliches Sicherheitsrisiko. Unter
    anderem da es so möglich war Accounts zu übernehmen, Validierungen von E-Mailsignaturen
    zu manipulieren, Anfrage umzuleiten und im Extremfall Code auf Systemen auszuführen.

    (Keine sensiblen Daten werden veröffentlicht; der Fokus liegt auf Forschung, Aufklärung
    und verantwortungsvollem Umgang mit den Ergebnissen.)


    Im Rahmen der Untersuchung zeigten sich nicht nur Fehlkonfigurationen, sondern
    auch Phänomene wie Bitsquatting und Typoquatting innerhalb der Verwaltungsnetze.
    Mit dem Betrieb eines DNS-Servers und dem Erwerb von bund.ee (naher Typosquatting/Bitquatting
    zu bund.de) konnten u.a. zahlreiche DNS-Anfragen von Servern des Bundesministerium
    des Innern (BMI) und weiterer Einrichtungen des Bundes empfangen werden.


    Der Vortrag beleuchtet die technischen und organisatorischen Schwachstellen, die
    hinter solchen Vorgängen stehen - und zeigt, wie DNS-Details Einblicke in die
    IT-Infrastruktur des Staates ermöglichen können. Abgerundet wird das Ganze durch
    praktische Beispiele, Datenanalysen und Empfehlungen, wie sich ähnliche Vorfälle
    künftig vermeiden lassen.


    In anderen Ländern sind gov-Domains als TLDs längst üblich (bspw. gov.uk) - in
    Deutschland ist bund.de oder gov.de allerdings nicht so verbreitet wie man glaubt,
    unter anderem da Bundesministerien eigene Domains nutzen oder nach Regierungsbildung
    umbenannt werden.

  description: '3D-Printers have given us all the unprecedented ability to manufacture
    mechanical parts with a very low barrier to entry.  The only thing between your
    idea and its physical manifestation is the process of designing the parts. However,
    this is actually a topic of incredible depth: Design engineering is a whole discipline
    to itself, built on top of tons and tons of heuristics to produce shapes that
    are functional, strong, and importantly: well-manufacturable


    In this talk, I will present the rules for designing well-printable parts and
    touch on other areas of design considerations so you can learn to create parts
    that work first try and can be reproduced by others on their 3d-printers easily.


    Over the years, the 3d-printing community has discovered many tricks and rules
    that help creating parts that can be printed well and fulfill their purpose as
    best as possible. I started collecting these rules and wrote an article guide
    to make this knowledge more accessible. I want to present the most important principles
    and the mindset that is needed to achieve perfected design.


    This is not about how to use a CAD program to design a part — but rather about
    the thought process of the design engineer while drawing up a part.  A though
    process that consists of compromises between many objectives, of heuristic rules,
    and many neat little tricks.

  description: 'Bluetooth headphones and earbuds are everywhere, and we were wondering
    what attackers could abuse them for. Sure, they can probably do things like finding
    out what the person is currently listening to. But what else? During our research
    we discovered three vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20700, CVE-2025-20701, CVE-2025-20702)
    in popular Bluetooth audio chips developed by Airoha. These chips are used by
    many popular device manufacturers in numerous Bluetooth headphones and earbuds.


    The identified vulnerabilities may allow a complete device compromise. We demonstrate
    the immediate impact using a pair of current-generation headphones. We also demonstrate
    how a compromised Bluetooth peripheral can be abused to attack paired devices,
    like smartphones, due to their trust relationship with the peripheral.


    This presentation will give an overview over the vulnerabilities and a demonstration
    and discussion of their impact. We also generalize these findings and discuss
    the impact of compromised Bluetooth peripherals in general. At the end, we briefly
    discuss the difficulties in the disclosure and patching process. Along with the
    talk, we will release tooling for users to check whether their devices are affected
    and for other researchers to continue looking into Airoha-based devices.


    Examples of affected vendors and devices are Sony (e.g., WH1000-XM5, WH1000-XM6,
    WF-1000XM5), Marshall (e.g. Major V, Minor IV), Beyerdynamic (e.g. AMIRON 300),
    or Jabra (e.g. Elite 8 Active).


    Airoha is a vendor that, amongst other things, builds Bluetooth SoCs and offers
    reference designs and implementations incorporating these chips. They have become
    a large supplier in the Bluetooth audio space, especially in the area of True
    Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds. Several reputable headphone and earbud vendors
    have built products based on Airoha’s SoCs and reference implementations using
    Airoha’s Software Development Kit (SDK).


    During our Bluetooth Auracast research we stumbled upon a pair of these headphones.
    During the process of obtaining the firmware for further research we initially
    discovered the powerful custom Bluetooth protocol called *RACE*. The protocol
    provides functionality to take full control of headphones. Data can be written
    to and read from the device''s flash and RAM.


    The goal of this presentation is twofold. Firstly, we want to inform about the
    vulnerabilities. It is important that headphone users are aware of the issues.
    In our opinion, some of the device manufacturers have done a bad job of informing
    their users about the potential threats and the available security updates. We
    also want to provide the technical details to understand the issues and enable
    other researchers to continue working with the platform. With the protocol it
    is possible to read and write firmware. This opens up the possibility to patch
    and potentially customize the firmware.


    Secondly, we want to discuss the general implications of compromising Bluetooth
    peripherals. As smart phones are becoming increasingly secure, the focus for attackers
    might shift to other devices in the environment of the smart phone. For example,
    when the Bluetooth Link Key, that authenticates a Bluetooth connection between
    the smart phone and the peripheral is stolen, an attacker might be able to impersonate
    the peripheral and gain its capabilities.

  description: 'Almost everyone has a household appliance at home, whether it''s a
    washing machine, dishwasher, or dryer. Despite their ubiquity, little is publicly
    documented about how these devices actually work or how their internal components
    communicate. This talk takes a closer look at proprietary bus systems, hidden
    diagnostic interfaces, and approaches to cloud-less integration of appliances
    from two well-known manufacturers into modern home automation systems.


    Modern home appliances may seem simple from the outside, but inside they contain
    complex electronic systems, proprietary communication protocols, and diagnostic
    interfaces rarely documented outside the manufacturer. In this talk, we''ll explore
    the challenges of reverse-engineering these systems: from analyzing appliance
    control boards and internal communication buses to decompiling and modifying firmware
    to better understand device functionality.


    We''ll also look at the security mechanisms designed to protect diagnostic access
    and firmware readout, and how these protections can be bypassed to enable deeper
    insight into device operation. Finally, this talk will demonstrate how the results
    of this research can be used to integrate even legacy home appliances into popular
    home automation platforms.


    This session combines examples and insights from the reverse-engineering of B/S/H/
    and Miele household appliances.

  description: 'Auch in der Schweizer Netzpolitik ging es im auslaufenden Jahr drunter
    und drüber. Wir blicken mit gewohntem Schalk auf das netzpolitische Jahr 2025
    zwischen Bodensee und Matterhorn zurück - und diskutieren jene Themen, die relevant
    waren und relevant bleiben.


    **Themen sind unter anderem:**



    **E-ID und E-Collecting:** Die netzpolitische Community hat nicht nur eine privatisierte
    E-ID verhindert sondern auch den Datenschutz als zentrales Prinzip verankert und
    einen beispielhaften Gesetzgebungsprozess begleitet. Das Gleiche haben wir bei
    E-Collecting vor, mit dem wir die direkte Demokratie der Schweiz auf ein neues
    Level heben wollen.



    **Elektronisches Gesundheitsdossier:** Was macht man, um eine Verschlechterung
    bei einem Produkt zu kaschieren? Richtig, man nimmt ein Rebranding vor. Und so
    heisst das E-PD nun E-GD.



    **Kabelaufklärung:** Im Dezember überraschte uns das Bundesverwaltungsgericht
    mit einem wegweisenden Urteil: Es beurteilte die Kabelaufklärung als nicht vereinbar
    mit der Bundesverfassung und der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention. Lässt
    das ganze aber 5 Jahr laufen.



    **What the VÜPF:** Wie die Schweiz zudem plant, das freie Internet weitgehend
    abzuschaffen. Wie der Stand der Verschärfung ist. Was wir und du dagegen tun können?



    **Plattformregulierung:** Ein Vorschlag zur Plattformregulierung wurde vom Bund
    ausgearbeitet - und nach der Verhängung von 39% Strafzoll still und heimlich in
    der Schublade versenkt. Doch der Bund fasste Mut - und wagt einen zaghaften Aufbruch.



    **KI-Regulierung & Leistungsschutzrecht:** Und wieso getraut sich der Bund, ein
    Leistungsschuzrecht einzuführen? Und mit der Motion «Gössi» KI-Sprachmodelle mit
    Schweizer Daten zu gefährden? (Spoiler: wegen der Verleger-Lobby)



    **Community in der Schweiz:** Winterkongress, Diversity und andere Aktivitäten.



    Nach dem Vortrag sind alle interessierten Personen eingeladen, die [Diskussion
    in einer self-organized Session](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/event/detail/treffen-der-netzpolitischen-community-der-sch_uoca)

    Wir haben eine Forderung: „Alle Parteien, die vom Verfassungsschutz als rechtsextremer
    Verdachtsfall oder gesichert rechtsextrem eingestuft werden, sollen durch das
    Bundesverfassungsgericht überprüft werden.“ Wir demonstrieren so lange, bis der
    Bundesrat die Prüfung formal beantragt hat. PRÜF-Demos. Bald in allen Landeshauptstädten.
    Am 2. Samstag. Jeden Monat.


    Warum beim Schutz der Demokratie nicht mal einen Ansatz wählen, der so noch nicht
    probiert wurde? Nicht auf die anderen gucken, sondern auf uns? Auf das gemeinsame?
    Auf Spaß? Das nutzen, was wir haben und was wir können? Wir haben das Grundgesetz,
    dessen Stärken eingesetzt werden müssen. Wir haben uns, Millionen Menschen, die
    wir uns organisieren können. Wir haben Ideen, wir haben Geld, wir haben Macht,
    wir haben Wissen. Bisher haben wir nicht einmal ansatzweise unsere Möglichkeiten

  description: 'Learn how to find your position using a sextant and a custom slide
    rule, almost no math required!


    Since the dawn of time people have asked themselves: where am I and why am I here?  This
    talk won''t help you answer the why question, but it will discuss how determine
    the where in the pre-GPS age of sextants, slide rules and stopwatches by taking
    the noon sight, aka the meridian passage.


    The usual way to find your position using the Sun requires a large almanac of
    lookup tables and some challenging math.  The books are frustrating to consult
    on every sight and the base 60 degree-minute-second math is frustrating even with
    a calculator, and if you''re on a traditional ship it seems wrong to do traditional
    navigation with electronic devices.


    To speed up the process I’ve designed a specialized circular slide rule that handles
    most of the table lookups to correct height of eye, semi-diameter, temperature,
    refraction and index errors, and also simplifies the degree-minute-second arithmetic
    required to calculate the exact declination of the Sun.


    In this talk I’ll demonstrate how to make your own printable paper slide rule
    and use it to reduce the meridian passage measurement to a lat/lon with just a
    few rotations of the wheels and pointer, no electronics or bulky books necessary!

  description: 'The Deutschlandticket was the flagship transport policy of the last
    government, rolled out in an impressive timescale for a political project; but
    this speed came with a cost - a system ripe for fraud at an industrial scale.


    German public transport is famously decentralised, with thousands of individual
    companies involved in ticketing and operations. Unifying all of these under one
    national, secure, system has proven a challenge too far for politicians. The end
    result: losses in the hundreds of millions of Euros, compensated to the transport
    companies from state and federal budgets to keep the system afloat, and nobody
    willing to take responsibility.


    This talk will cover the political, policy, and technical mistakes that lead to
    this mess; how we can learn from these mistakes; and what we can do to ensure
    the Deutschlandticket has a viable future.


    At last years Congress Q presented [a deep-dive into the technical details of
    train ticketing](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-what-s-inside-my-train-ticket) and
    its [Zügli](https://zügli.app) platform for this; since then, things have gone
    rather out of hand. The little side-project for looking into the details of train
    tickets turned into a full-time project for detecting ticketing fraud. This talk
    details an executive summary of the madness that has been the past year, and how
    we accidentally ended up in national and international politics working to secure
    the Deutschlandticket.


    Shortly after last year''s talk, we were contacted about some *interesting* looking
    tickets someone noticed, issued by the Vetter GmbH Omnibus- und Mietwagenbetrieb
    - or so they claimed to be. These were normal Deutschlandtickets, but with a few
    weird mistakes in them. At first, we thought nothing much of it; mistakes happen.
    But, on further investigation, these turned out to not be legitimate tickets at
    all, but rather from a fraudulent website by the name of d-ticket.su, using the
    private signing key obtained under suspicious circumstances. How exactly this
    key came into the wrong hands remains unclear, but we present the possible explanations
    for how this could''ve happened, how many responsible have been thoroughly uncooperative
    in getting to the bottom of this, and how the supporting systems and processes
    of the Deutschlandticket were unable to cope with this situation.


    Parallel to this, another fraud has been draining the transport companies of their
    much-needed cash: SEPA Direct Debit fraud. Often, a direct debit payment can be
    setup online with little more than an IBAN and ticking a box; and most providers
    of the Deutschlandticket offer an option to pay via direct debit. Fraudsters have
    noticed this, and mass purchase Deutschlandtickets with invalid or stolen IBANs
    before flipping them for a discounted price on Telegram; made easier because most
    transport companies issue a ticket immediately, before the direct debit has been
    fully processed. The supporting systems of the Deutschlandticket in many cases
    don''t even provide for the revocation of such tickets. We will detail the hallmarks
    of this fraud, how transport companies can work to prevent it, and how we tracked
    down the fraudsters by their own careless mistakes.

  description: 'Wer nutzt in Deutschland Software von Palantir und wer hat das in
    naher Zukunft vor? Was sind die rechtlichen Voraussetzungen für den Einsatz solcher
    Analysewerkzeuge? Und was plant Innenminister Alexander Dobrindt in Sachen Palantir
    für die Polizeien des Bundes?


    Software von Palantir analysiert für Polizeien und Militär deren Daten – dafür
    lizenzieren auch deutsche Polizeibehörden seit Jahren die Analysesoftware Gotham
    des US-Unternehmens. Die Software verarbeitet strukturierte und unstrukturierte
    Informationen aus Polizeidatenbanken. Die genauen Funktionsweisen sind für die
    Öffentlichkeit, Gesetzgeber und Kontrollbehörden jedoch nicht einsehbar.


    Das US-Unternehmen ist hochumstritten und auch in Deutschland seit einigen Gesetzesinitiativen
    wieder umkämpft – wegen seiner intransparenten Analysemethoden, seiner Zusammenarbeit
    mit autoritären Staaten und seiner Nähe zur US-Regierung.


    Rechtlich ist der Einsatz von Analysetools wie von Palantir in Deutschland ohnehin
    komplex, denn das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat 2023 deutliche Grenzen für polizeiliche
    Datenanalysen gezogen. Dennoch haben mehrere Bundesländer für ihre Polizeien Verträge
    oder streben sie an. Auch auf Bundesebene wird der Einsatz für das Bundeskriminalamt
    und die Bundespolizei hitzig diskutiert.


    Wie funktioniert Gotham und welche Gefahren gehen damit einher?

    Welche Entwicklungen sind im Bund und in den Ländern zu beobachten? Wie geht es
    weiter?


    Wir wollen über den Stand der Dinge in Bund und Ländern informieren und auch zeigen,
    wie wir versuchen, rechtliche Vorgaben durchzusetzen. Denn die GFF und der CCC
    sind an Verfassungsbeschwerden beteiligt, unter anderem in Hessen, Hamburg und
    zuletzt in Bayern.

  description: "Agentic AI is the catch-all term for AI-enabled systems that propose\
    \ to complete more or less complex tasks on their own, without stopping to ask\
    \ permission or consent. What could go wrong? These systems are being integrated\
    \ directly into operating systems and applications, like web browsers. This move\
    \ represents a fundamental paradigm shift, transforming them from relatively neutral\
    \ resource managers into an active, goal-oriented infrastructure ultimately controlled\
    \ by the companies that develop these systems, not by users or application developers.\
    \ Systems like Microsoft's \"Recall,\" which create a comprehensive \"photographic\
    \ memory\" of all user activity, are marketed as productivity enhancers, but they\
    \ function as OS-level surveillance and create significant privacy vulnerabilities.\
    \ In the case of Recall, we’re talking about a centralized, high-value target\
    \ for attackers that poses an existential threat to the privacy guarantees of\
    \ meticulously engineered applications like Signal. This shift also fundamentally\
    \ undermines personal agency, replacing individual choice and discovery with automated,\
    \ opaque recommendations that can obscure commercial interests and erode individual\
    \ autonomy.\n\nThis talk will review the immediate and serious danger that the\
    \ rush to shove agents into our devices and digital lives poses to our fundamental\
    \ right to privacy and our capacity for genuine personal agency. Drawing from\
    \ Signal's analysis, it moves beyond outlining the problem to also present a \"\
    tourniquet\" solution: looking at what we need to do *now* to ensure that privacy\
    \ at the application layer isn’t eliminated, and what the hacker community can\
    \ do to help. We will outline a path for ensuring developer agency, granular user\
    \ control, radical transparency, and the role of adversarial research.\n\nThe\
    \ talk will provide a critical technical and political economy analysis of the\
    \ new privacy crisis emerging from OS and application level AI agents, aimed at\
    \ the 39C3 \"Ethics, Society & Politics\" audience.\n\n1. Defining the Threat:\
    \ The OS as a Proactive Participant (5 mins)\n We will begin by defining \"Agentic\
    \ AI\" in two contexts - imbibed into the operating system and deployed via critical\
    \ gateway applications such as web browsers. Traditionally, the operating systems\
    \ and browsers are largely neutral enforcers of user agency, managing resources\
    \ and providing APIs for applications to run reliably. We will argue that this\
    \ neutrality is close to being eliminated. The new paradigm shifts these applications\
    \ into a proactive agent that actively observes, records, and anticipates user\
    \ actions across all applications.The prime example for this analysis will be\
    \ Microsoft’s \"Recall\" feature, Google’s Magic Cue, and OpenAI’s Atlas. Politically,\
    \ we will frame this not as a \"feature\" but as the implementation of pervasive,\
    \ non-consensual surveillance and remote-control infrastructure. This \"photographic\
    \ memory\" of and demand for non-differentiated access to everything from private\
    \ Signal messages to financial data to health data creates a catastrophic single\
    \ point of failure, making a single security breach an existential threat to a\
    \ user's entire digital life. Ultimately, we hope to illustrate how putting our\
    \ brains in a jar (with agentic systems) is effectively a prompt injection attack\
    \ against our own humanity.\n\n2. The Existential Threat to Application-Level\
    \ Privacy (10 mins)\n The core of the talk will focus on what this means for privacy-first\
    \ applications like Signal. We will explain the \"blood-brain barrier\" analogy:\
    \ secure apps are meticulously engineered to minimize data and protect communications,\
    \ relying on the OS to be a stable, neutral foundation on which to build. This\
    \ new OS trend breaks that barrier. We will demonstrate how OS-level surveillance\
    \ renders application-level privacy features, including end-to-end encryption,\
    \ effectively useless. If the OS can screenshot a message before it's encrypted\
    \ or after it's decrypted, the promise of privacy is broken, regardless of the\
    \ app's design. We will also discuss the unsustainable \"clever hacks\" (like\
    \ Signal using a DRM feature) that developers are forced to implement, underscoring\
    \ the need for a structural solution.\n\n3. An Actionable Framework for Remediation\
    \ (20 mins)\n The final, and most important, part of the talk will move from critique\
    \ to action. We will present an actionable four-point framework as a \"tourniquet\"\
    \ to address these immediate dangers:\n\na. Empower Developers: Demand clear,\
    \ officially supported APIs for developers to designate individual applications\
    \ as \"sensitive\" with the default posture being for such applications being\
    \ opted-out of access by agentic systems (either OS or application based) (default\
    \ opt-out)\n\nb. Granular User Control: Move beyond all-or-nothing permissions.\
    \ Users must have explicit, fine-grained control to grant or deny AI access on\
    \ an app-by-app basis.\n\nc. Mandate Radical Transparency: OS vendors and application\
    \ developers must clearly disclose what data is accessed, how it's used, and how\
    \ it's protected—in human-readable terms, not buried in legalese. Laws and regulations\
    \ must play an essential role but we cannot just wait for them to be enforced,\
    \ or it will be too late.\n\nd. Encourage and Protect Adversarial Research: We\
    \ will conclude by reinforcing the need for a pro-privacy, pro-security architecture\
    \ by default, looking at the legal frameworks that govern these processes and\
    \ why they need to be enforced, and finally asking the attendees to continue exposing\
    \ vulnerabilities in such systems. It was only due to technically-grounded collective\
    \ outrage that Recall was re-architected by Microsoft and we will need that energy\
    \ if we are to win this war.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\

  description: "This talk demonstrates end-to-end prompt injection exploits that compromise\
    \ agentic systems. Specifically, we will discuss exploits that target computer-use\
    \ and coding agents, such as Anthropic's Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Google Jules,\
    \ Devin AI, ChatGPT Operator, Amazon Q, AWS Kiro, and others. \n\nExploits will\
    \ impact confidentiality, system integrity, and the future of AI-driven automation,\
    \ including remote code execution, exfiltration of sensitive information such\
    \ as access tokens, and even joining Agents to traditional command and control\
    \ infrastructure. Which are known as \"ZombAIs\", a term first coined by the presenter\
    \ as well as long-term prompt injection persistence in AI coding agents.\n\nAdditionally,\
    \ we will explore how nation state TTPs such as ClickFix apply to Computer-Use\
    \ systems and how they can trick AI systems and lead to full system compromise\
    \ (AI ClickFix). \n\nFinally, we will cover current mitigation strategies and\
    \ forward-looking recommendations and strategic thoughts.\n\nDuring the Month\
    \ of AI Bugs (August 2025), I responsibly disclosed over two dozen security vulnerabilities\
    \ across all major agentic AI coding assistants. This talk distills the most severe\
    \ findings and patterns observed.\n\nKey highlights include:\n* Critical prompt-injection\
    \ exploits enabling zero-click data exfiltration and arbitrary remote code execution\
    \ across multiple platforms and vendor products\n* Recurring systemic flaws such\
    \ as over-reliance on LLM behavior for trust decisions, inadequate sandboxing\
    \ of tools, and weak user-in-the-loop controls.\n* How I leveraged AI to find\
    \ some of these vulnerabilities quickly\n* The AI Kill Chain: prompt injection,\
    \ confused deputy behavior, and automatic tool invocation\n* Adaptation of nation-state\
    \ TTPs (e.g., ClickFix) into AI ClickFix techniques that can fully compromise\
    \ computer-use systems.\n* Insights about vendor responses: from quick patches\
    \ and CVEs to months of silence, or quiet patching\n* AgentHopper will highlight\
    \ how these vulnerabilities combined could have led to an AI Virus\n\nFinally,\
    \ the session presents practical mitigations and forward-looking strategies to\
    \ reduce the growing attack surface of probabilistic, autonomous AI systems.\n\

  description: 'WhiteDate ist eine Plattform weißer Suprematist:innen, die sich an
    Rassist:innen und Antisemit:innen richtet – und auf veralteter Infrastruktur basiert.
    Was die 8000 Mitglieder nicht wussten: Einige der Nazis flirteten dieses Jahr
    mit realistisch wirkenden Chatbots -  und verliebten sich sogar in sie. Mit einer
    Kombination aus automatisierter Konversationsanalyse, Web-Scraping und klassischen
    OSINT-Methoden verfolgten wir öffentliche Spuren und identifizierten die Personen
    hinter der Seite. Dieser Vortrag zeigt, wie KI-Personas und investigatives Denken
    extremistische Netzwerke aufdecken und wie Algorithmen gegen Extremismus eingesetzt
    werden können.


    Monatelang tauchte Martha in die verborgene Welt von WhiteDate, WhiteChild und
    WhiteDeal ein, drei Plattformen, die von einer Rechtsextremistin aus Deutschland
    betrieben werden. Sie glaubt an die Verschwörung einer weißen Vorherrschaft und
    einer „rassisch reinen“ weißen Gemeinschaft.  Was als Neugier begann, entwickelte
    sich schnell zu einem Experiment über menschliches Verhalten, Technologie und
    Absurdität.


    Martha infiltrierte das Portal mit „realistischen“ KI-Chatbots. Die Bots waren
    so überzeugend, dass sie die Überprüfungen umgingen und sogar als „weiß“ verifiziert
    worden. Durch die Gespräche und Recherche von digitalen Spuren dieser Gemeinschaft,
    die sich in Sicherheit wähnte, konnte sie Nutzer identifizieren.


    Gemeinsam mit Reporter:innen der „Die Zeit“ konnten wir die Person hinter der
    Plattform enttarnen und ihre Radikalisierung von einer erfolgreichen Pianistin
    zu einer Szene-Unternehmerin nachzeichnen. Um ihr Dating-Portal hat sie ein Netzwerk
    von Websites aufgebaut, dass seinen Nutzern Liebe, Treue und Tradition vermarktet.
    WhiteDate verspricht romantische Beziehungen, WhiteChild propagiert Familien-
    und Abstammungsideale und WhiteDeal ermöglicht berufliches Networking und „gegenseitige
    Unterstützung“ unter einem rassistischen Weltbild. Gemeinsam zeigen sie, wie Ideologie
    und Einsamkeit auf bizarre Weise miteinander verwoben sein können.


    Nach monatelanger Beobachtung, klassischer OSINT-Recherche, automatisierter Gesprächsanalyse
    und Web-Scraping haben wir herausgefunden, wer hinter diesen Plattformen steckt
    und wie ihre Infrastruktur funktioniert. Dabei deckten wir die Widersprüche und
    Absurditäten extremistischer Gemeinschaften auf, verdeutlichten ihre Anfälligkeit
    für technologische Eingriffe und brachten sogar den einen oder anderen Nazi zum
    Weinen.


    Dieser Vortrag erzählt von Beobachtung, Schabernack und Einblicken in die digitale
    Welt extremistischer Gruppen. Er zeigt, wie Algorithmen, KI-Personas und investigatives
    Denken Hass entlarven, seine Narrative hinterfragen und seine Echokammern aufbrechen
    können. Wir zeigen, wie Technologie im Kampf gegen Extremismus eingesetzt werden
    kann.
