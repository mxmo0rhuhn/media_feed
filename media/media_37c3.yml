  description: 'The Solar System has had 8 planets ever since Pluto was excluded in
    2006. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad
    move. But did you know Neptune was discovered as the 12th planet? Or that, 80
    years before Star Trek, astronomers seriously suspected a planet called Vulcan
    near the Sun? This talk will take you through centuries of struggling with the
    question: Do you even planet?!


    In antiquity, scientists counted the 7 classical planets: the Moon, Mercury, Venus,
    the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn – but their model of the universe was wrong.
    Two thousand years later, a new model was introduced. It was less wrong, and it
    brought the number of planets down to 6: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
    Saturn. Since then, it''s been a roller coaster ride of planet discoveries and
    dismissals.


    In this talk, we stagger through the smoke and mirrors of scientific history.
    We meet old friends like Uranus and Neptune, forgotten lovers like Ceres, Psyche
    and Eros, fallen celebrities like Pluto, regicidal interlopers like Eris and Makemake
    as well as mysterious strangers like Vulcan, Planet X and Planet Nine.


    Find out how science has been tricked by its own vanity, been hampered by too
    little (or too much!) imagination, and how human drama can make a soap opera out
    of a question as simple as: How Many Planets in Our Solar System?

  description: "Hardware hacking tooling for the new iPhone generation\n\nIf you've\
    \ followed the iPhone hacking scene you probably heard about cables such as the\
    \ Kanzi Cable, Kong Cable, Bonobo Cable, and so on: Special cables that allow\
    \ access to hardware debugging features on Lightning-based iPhones such as UART\
    \ and JTAG. However with the iPhone 15, all of those tools became basically useless:\
    \ USB-C is here, and with that we need new hardware and software tooling.\n\n\
    This talk gives you a brief history of iPhone hardware hacking through the Lightning\
    \ port, and then looks at the new iPhone 15, and how - using vendor defined messages,\
    \ modifying existing tooling like the Central Scrutinizer, and a bit of hardware\
    \ hacking - we managed to get access to the (unfortunately locked on production\
    \ devices) JTAG interface exposed on the USB-C port on the new iPhone 15.\n\n\
    And how you can do it using open-source tooling too.\n\nThe iPhone's Lightning\
    \ connector was a proprietary beast with a lot of hidden features: By sending\
    \ custom SDQ commands there, it was possible to get it to expose hardware debugging\
    \ features such as JTAG and UART. For a long time, this was only easily possible\
    \ using either gray and black-market cables such as the Kanzi-Cable, or proprietary\
    \ tools such as the Bonobo Cable. Last year, we released an open-source tool to\
    \ get access to the iPhone debugging features called the Tamarin Cable - finally\
    \ allowing anyone to get JTAG and UART on the iPhone for just a couple of $ in\
    \ parts. \n\nBut then the iPhone 15 came along, and with that USB-C: All previous\
    \ hardware and software tooling basically became useless, but that did not stop\
    \ us from trying: We knew from the Apple Silicon macs and the work of t8012-team\
    \ and the AsahiLinux project that Apple uses USB-C's VDM feature - Vendor Defined\
    \ Messages - to allow access to features such as the UART console, and so chances\
    \ were high that we could use something similar to get access to the hardware\
    \ debugging features on the iPhone 15.\n\nSo we pre-ordered the iPhone 15, a couple\
    \ of PCBs, a case of Club Mate and got started: And less than 48 hours after the\
    \ launch we got JTAG working on the iPhone 15.\n\nIn this talk we will start by\
    \ looking at the history of iPhone and Lightning hardware hacking, and then look\
    \ at how USB-C is used for debugging on Apple Silicon devices, and what we had\
    \ to do to get JTAG on the iPhone 15.\n\nWe will also use this talk to release\
    \ the new version of the open-source Tamarin Cable firmware: Tamarin-C. A fully\
    \ integrated, open-source debugging probe for the iPhone 15 and other Apple Silicon\
    \ devices. Tamarin-C is also able to give access to a DFU mode that you can't\
    \ access without sending VDMs.\n\n\nNote: This talk will not contain any 0days\
    \ or previously unknown vulnerabilities. Production iPhones are locked, and so\
    \ while we get access to some of the device's busses we can't for example access\
    \ the CPU core.\n\n\nThis talk is about building tooling for future work.\nabout\

  description: 'This talk will present details of the TETRA:BURST vulnerablities -
    the result of the first public in-depth security analysis of TETRA (Terrestrial
    Trunked Radio): a European standard for trunked radio globally used by government
    agencies, police, military, and critical infrastructure relying on secret cryptographic
    algorithms which we reverse-engineered and published in August 2023. Adding to
    our initial disclosure, this talk will present new details on our deanonymization
    attack and provide additional insights into background and new developments.


    In August 2023, we published the TETRA:BURST vulnerablities - the result of the
    first public in-depth security analysis of TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio):
    a European standard for trunked radio globally used by government agencies, police,
    military, and critical infrastructure. Authentication and encryption within TETRA
    are handled by proprietary cryptographic cipher-suites, which had remained secret
    for over two decades through restrictive NDAs until our reverse-engineering and
    publication.


    TETRA:BURST consists of five vulnerabilities, two of which are critical, including
    the backdoored TEA1 cipher (crackable in minutes on commodity hardware by a passive
    adversary), a keystream recovery attack (which works regardless of the cipher
    employed), and a deanonymization attack with counter-intelligence implications.


    In this talk, we will discuss and demonstrate the TETRA:BURST vulnerabilities
    themselves and will - for the first time - disclose the details of the TA61 identity
    anonymization primitive and our Meet-in-the-Middle deanonymization attack against
    it. In addition, we will provide more background on how the TEA1 backdoor proliferated
    throughout Europe and provide attendees with an update on new developments since
    our initial disclosure, the future of TETRA, and the vast amount of TETRA hardening
    work that still needs to be done in critical infrastructure.

    und der Fahrzeugtyp ist „Sporttauchboot”. Vom Fund eines Drucktanks bis zum ersten
    Tauchgang auf den Grund eines Tagebausees – wir erzählen von unseren größten Herausforderungen
    sowie Fehlschlägen.


    Wir laden euch ein zu einem technischen Beratungsgespräch für alle, die schonmal
    mit dem Gedanken gespielt haben, ein U-Boot zu bauen.


    Die einzelnen Systeme eines U-Boots sind nicht kompliziert. Aber die Schwierigkeit
    liegt in der Summe der Einzelsysteme, die auf engem Raum im Zusammenspiel sicher
    funktionieren müssen. Der Fokus des Vortrags liegt neben unserer kurzweiligen
    Geschichte auf den technischen Schwierigkeiten, zu denen sich in der Literatur
    wenig findet oder wegen derer es nicht gleich auf Anhieb funktioniert hat. Damit
    ihr, falls ihr ähnliches plant, einen besseren Start habt und von unseren Fehlern
    profitieren könnt.


    Was gibt es bei der Wahl eines geeigneten Drucktanks zu beachten?

    Wie lässt sich eine wasserdichte Luke konstruieren?

    Drahtlose Unterwasserkommunikation mittels Ultraschall?

    Wie bauen wir Redundanz in die Systeme ein?

    Wie werden wir das CO2 los, um nicht zu ersticken?

    Warum sind auf einmal Risse in den Scheiben?

    Was tun, wenn nichts mehr geht?

    Und was, wenn dann auch noch die Polizei kommt?


    In dem Vortrag geht es nicht um Probleme anderer kaputter U-Boote. Wir werden
    das Titan-Desaster mit maximal einer Folie behandeln.

  description: 'Introducing a novel technique for e-mail spoofing.


    SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, allows e-mailing since 1982. This easily
    makes it one of the oldest technologies amongst the Internet. However, even though
    it seems to have stood the test of time, there was still a trivial but novel exploitation
    technique just waiting to be discovered – SMTP smuggling!

    In this talk, we’ll explore how SMTP smuggling breaks the interpretation of the
    SMTP protocol in vulnerable server constellations worldwide, allowing some more
    than unwanted behavior. Sending e-mails as admin@microsoft.com to fortune 500
    companies – while still passing SPF checks – will be the least of our problems!

    From identifying this novel technique to exploiting it in one of the most used
    e-mail services on the Internet, we’ll dive into all the little details this attack
    has to offer. Therefore, in this talk, we’ll embark on an expedition beyond the
    known limits of SMTP, and venture into the uncharted territories of SMTP smuggling!
